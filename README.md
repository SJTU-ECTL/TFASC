# TFASC
This project implements the efficient method for the target function approximation for stochastic circuit minimization proposed in our paper [1].

Reference paper(s):
- [1]: Exploring Target Function Approximation for Stochastic Circuit Minimization (Chen Wang, Weihua Xiao, John P. Hayes, and Weikang Qian, ICCAD 2020)

The following two directories provide the two major programs.

- [Bernstein Polynomial Approximation by Matlab](https://github.com/SJTU-ECTL/TFASC/tree/master/Bernstein%20polynomial%20approximation%20by%20Matlab) is supposed to be run before TFASC program to prepare the input file for it.

- [TFASC main program](https://github.com/SJTU-ECTL/TFASC/tree/master/TFASC%20main%20program) is the program for the Dynamic Approximation (DA) method as the best method proposed in our paper [1]. Later on we will also add the programs for the remaining proposed Perturbation (PER) method and the Degree-Precision Scanning (DPS) method here.

Please refer to `readme.md` in both directories for more details.
