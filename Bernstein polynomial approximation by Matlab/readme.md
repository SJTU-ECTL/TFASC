# Bernstein Polynomial Approximation for the Target Function by Matlab

This program is run before TFASC to prepare for its input files regarding to the target function to be approximated.

This program implements the method proposed in [ref1] to realize the closest approximation of a target function with degree-n Bernstein polynomial. More over, given a precision parameter m, it also finds the corresponding feature vector (the same as "problem vector" in [ref2]) of the Bernstein polynomial.

## Requirements

To run this program, Matlab2016 or later versions are recommended. The program is implemented for Matlab in Windows OS. If it is run in Linux, the directory format in the scripts shall be modified.
