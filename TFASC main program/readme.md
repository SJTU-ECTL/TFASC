# Target Function Approximation for Stochastic Circuit Minimization (TFASC)

This project implements the efficient method of target function approximation for stochastic circuit minimization. Given an error bound, the program finds a minimized SC circuit with the approximation error over the target function satisfying the error bound.

## Requirements

- OS: 32-bit Linux (since the tool MVSIS used here cannot be run in 64-bit OS currently)
- gcc
- g++
- make
- libreadline
- ctags
- PERL
- EDA logic synthesis tools: ABC, MVSIS executive files

## Input Format
Content in the "input.txt" file:
```
degree n
precision m
feature vector
```
For example, the content of the input file "bm1.2.txt" for bm1.2 is:
```
4
8
0 254 771 723 215
```
where 4 on the 1st line is for degree n = 4, and 8 on the 2nd line is for the precision parameter m = 8. On the 3rd line is the input feature vector corresponding to the closest Bernstein polynomial approximating the target function. This input file can be generated by the Matlab program in [here](https://github.com/SJTU-ECTL/TFASC/tree/master/Bernstein%20polynomial%20approximation%20by%20Matlab).
